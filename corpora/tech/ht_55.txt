Using QuickTime on Windows could let hackers control your PC | tech$top | Hindustan Times
The US government recommended Windows PC users to uninstall Apple’s QuickTime video player after a security software maker (Trend Micro) discovered two new bugs in the software on Thursday. Trend Micro said it had uncovered two critical vulnerabilities in the version of the QuickTime media player for Microsoft’s Windows operating system, which could be leveraged to launch attacks on PCs on visiting a malicious web page or opening a tainted file. The warning does not apply to QuickTime for Apple’s Mac computers, as it’s still getting security updates. A spokesman for Apple declined comment.

Google.com partially dangerous according to their safe browsing tool | tech$tech-news | Hindustan Times

 The Safe Browsing tool by Google is supposed to warn you about sites that might cause harm to your smartphone, tablet or computer. According to a report, the tool has labelled Google.com as partially dangerous.  The tool browses billions of URLs everyday to find ones that might jeopardise your computer’s security. It also explains how it might think that the website might be harmful. In this case, Google has marked its own domain harmful by stating that some pages on this site may try and install harmful software on the device they’re open on.  While the most recent report was noticed on Tuesday, blog posts from as far back as November point out the same. But Google isn’t the only popular site marked with an alarming status. Even Tumblr and Github are marked as not completely safe.

Their roster of authors include Arundhati Roy, William Dalrymple, Prashant Kishor, Twinkle Khanna, Sunny Leone, Rujuta Diwekar, Husain Haqqani, Svetlana Alexievich, Rajdeep Sardesai and Rajat Gupta. The company has been working on original titles under the leader ship of publisher, Chiki Sarkar and CEO Durga Raghunath since inception in 2015.  Juggernaut’s priorities are simple. They are making books less intimidating by bringing a library on the mobile devices we can’t stay away from. They want to get more Indians hooked on books by making reading easier with reading mode that can be customised to personal liking. The company also wants more Indians to write by simplifying the process of publishing and distribution.  Publisher Chikki Sarkar, who has worked at Bloomsbury Publishing and  Random House joined CEO, Durga Raghunath (headed Network 18, WSJ in India and growth at Zomato) to co-found Juggernaut. The mobile-first book publisher plans to launch a lineup physical books in July, but for now, PayTM is handling the subscriptions and purchases on the app. This will also help them keep a track of books being read and the feedback they receive.  With backing from the likes of Infosys CEO and managing director of Fabindia, they plan to introduce features that take reading books beyond what’s also possible with physical books. With the app, you can buy a section of the book for fraction of the price and even send books as gifts.

Google Chromcast and Audio launched in India for Rs 3,399 | tech$gadgets | Hindustan Times
Google has launched the second generation of Chromecast in India, six months after they were launched in the US. Instead of one, there are two successors to the Chromecast -- one for video and the other for audio. The new Chromecasts look like disks instead of dongles and will be available for Rs 3,399. Google is also offering six month of Saavn subscription with every purchase of Chromecast hinting that Google Play Music won’t be making it to India shores for at least that much time.  The Chromecast is like the older streaming dongle with hardware and design upgrades, While the Chromecast Audio is a high fidelity music streamer.  There are two ways to steam content to your speakers and TV with the Chromecasts -- from a compatible app or the Chromecast app.  “Chromecast turns any TV into a smart TV for a fraction of the cost. The new Chromecast has an updated design, making it easier to fit into TVs with crowded ports. It supports the latest WiFi standards and adapts to changing WiFi conditions in most homes, ensuring higher quality video with less buffering. In addition to movies, TV shows and music are available through apps including Netflix, Hooq, Eros Now and YouTube. Chromecast also offers a range of popular single and multi-player games including Angry Birds Go and Just Dance Now,” said Google.  “With Chromecast Audio, it is now possible to create a seamless home audio system with unmatched compatibility and affordability. The small device plugs into existing speakers to stream music, radio and podcasts over WiFi, similar to Chromecast. It works with a number of apps including Saavn and Wynk Music. The multi-room feature makes it possible to connect multiple speakers throughout a living space,” said Google about the Chromecast audio. The new Chromecast will be available on Flipkart, Snapdeal, Paytm and retailers like Reliance and Croma among others.

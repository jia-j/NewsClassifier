Bots are Back, and They Might Even Be Welcome - The New York Times
Bots have a bad reputation. For years, people have thought of bots — automated online tools that perform all sorts of tasks — as annoying digital critters that do a bad job of substituting for humans in call centers or that inflate traffic numbers by pretending to read websites. But the bot may be getting reformed. At Facebook’s annual developer conference on Tuesday, the social media giant unveiled a way for bot developers to build bot code into the company’s Messenger communications platform. These bots, the company says, are meant to cut down on your app overload. Instead of scrolling through dozens of different apps, imagine if you had just a handful of bots doing all that work for you — sort of like Amazon’s Echo device. A start-up called Spring, for example, allows you to text for shopping help on Messenger. But instead of a person helping you on the other side, it’s a bit of code providing you with information. The growing power and simplicity of artificial intelligence technology makes such a thing possible. Not to be outdone, Google on Wednesday said it was introducing an A.I. tool that helps you schedule fun time around work time in your Calendar application. Groundbreaking stuff? No, not yet. But at least it sounds useful.

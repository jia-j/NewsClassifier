Now plan better road trips with Google Maps | tech$top | Hindustan Times
Now you can use Google Maps app on the phone to navigate your way to a destination while making multiple pitstops.  However, there is a catch. You can only set pit stops and plan out a trip on the desktop version of Google Maps. Select an origin and destination. Then add point onthe way that have to be covered, during the trip. The map then generates a route according to your preferences.  If you’re acquaint with Google Maps on the desktop, you’ll try and send the directions to your phone via the “send to phone” option. To that, Google says that the option isn’t available because it’s not a route that they’d make available on the phone.  But, if you copy the URL of the route and mail it to yourself, you can open it on the phone. and the same route you set up on the desktop will be available. That  Google probably doesn’t want to give you the option straight away because its in testing phases and their reputation,  unlike Apple’s maps are still in good shape. But this is also a useful trick when you have to make your way home while dropping people off on the way. You can generate one URL if the trip remains the same and save it to use it every time.

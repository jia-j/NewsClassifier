LG expected to launch budget phones in India | tech news | Hindustan Times
LG is set to launch new phones in India, following the launch of its G5 flagship in international markets. The phone being introduced in India are expected to make a presence in the budget establishing the brand’s presence in the budget segment.  LG has made some great phones in the past -- Flex 2, Nexus 5, Nexus 5x -- but its grip on the smartphone market seems to be loosening. The LG G5 with modules might be the first modular phone to see success in the market.  The budget segment however, has been taken over by players like Xiaomi that offer top-notch specs and features at affordable prices. LG’s been able to make its presence in the mid-range with the Nexus 5x and is expected to enter the flagship with the G5 and its friends. However, the company may be looking at a piece of the budget pie and we’ll likely see a few new offerings from LG on that.

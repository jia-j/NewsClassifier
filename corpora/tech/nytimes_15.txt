Another Social Media Giant Embraces Algorithms - The New York Times
We live in the age of the algorithm. Algorithms help determine our credit scores. They offer us music samples based on our tastes and advertisements based on what we view online. They help control traffic and even predict which baseball prospect will be a star and which one will be a bust. What may surprise many is that some leading social media sites have been slow to embrace the personalized algorithm, and have instead relied on old-fashioned chronological order. Facebook, of course, shifted away from reverse chronological news feeds about seven years ago — a change initially greeted with horror from hardcore Facebook users. Which is to say, the shift drew the same reaction as just about every other change at Facebook. Last month Twitter introduced older, popular tweets to the top of users’ feeds that showed up if they had been away from Twitter for a while. Now Instagram is embracing algorithms. On Tuesday, the photo-sharing service said it planned to begin testing an algorithm-based personalized feed similar to the one already being used by its parent company, Facebook. The change was inevitable. As social sites grow and users interact with more and more people, the reverse chronological feed can feel unwieldy. Nonetheless, don’t be surprised if ardent Instagram users howl their disapproval.

Facebook confirmed to Mashable tech website that it is testing the new, sectioned news feed, in addition to the current format, though it is unclear if the feature would ever get an official launch. Some screenshots surfaced on Twitter on Friday, showing that a new layout of the mobile app that highlighted multiple news sections, with topics such as world and us, sports and food.  “People have told us they would like options to see more stories on Facebook around specific topics they are interested in,” a Facebook spokesperson was quoted as saying.  “So we have been testing a few feeds for people to view more and different stories from people and Pages based on topic areas,” the spokesperson added. The report said the move would encourage users to get more news from Facebook rather than other sources like Twitter or Google News.

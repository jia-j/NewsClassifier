Freeing Lonely iPad Apps From Almost Empty Folders - The New York Times
Q. After removing old apps I never use from my iPad, I find I have a few folders that contain only one app. How do I get rid of the folder enclosures and put the app back out with the others on the home screen, or move it to a different folder with other apps? A. Removing lonely apps from near-empty folders begins in a similar manner to putting apps in folders. Just open the folder and press down on the app’s icon until it (and all the other apps on the screen) begins to wiggle; the wiggling means you can move them around the iPad’s home screen or delete them from your tablet. When you have the folder open, just put your finger on the single app inside and drag it onto the home screen. Once the folder is empty, it disappears. Press the Home button and the icons should stop jiggling and return to their normal static behavior. If you want to transplant the app into a more populated folder, drag it out of its original location with your finger and position it over the folder you want to use; you can drag it across different home pages by moving to the edge of the screen and continuing on. Take your finger off the screen when the app “drops” into the new folder and then press the Home button to finish the job. If you use iTunes to sync your iPad, you can also organize and rearrange the apps on your device when it is connected to your computer. Apple’s support site has illustrated instructions for both the Mac and Windows versions of iTunes.

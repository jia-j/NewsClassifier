LG launches portable rolling keyboard successor  | tech$top | Hindustan Times
LG has launched the successor to Rolly with the same name but a postfix 2. The new portable keyboard has five rows of keys -- one more than the predecessor -- and rolls up into a stick that’s easy to carry around.  It can pair with up to three devices over Bluetooth and serve as a dock for a phone to resemble convertible 2-in-1 with the tiniest of screens.  The portable keyboard is now available in South Korea for roughly $110, and like the Rolly, is expected to arrive in India sometime this year.

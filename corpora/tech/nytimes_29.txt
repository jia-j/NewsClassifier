Microsoft Goes on Offensive Against Justice Department - The New York Times
Sometimes, you have to go on the offensive. That appears to be the thinking behind a lawsuit filed by Microsoft on Thursday against the Justice Department, arguing that the government is wrongly preventing the software giant from letting customers know when investigators armed with a court order have obtained customer data. Law enforcement, of course, has long had the ability to get a court order requiring someone to provide access to information, whether it’s a filing cabinet or a computer hard drive. Usually, it wasn’t too difficult for the target of the investigation to find out what was taken. But cloud computing has changed that equation. When customer information is stored in a giant data center run by companies like Google, Apple and Microsoft, investigators can go straight to the information they need, even getting a judge to order the company to keep quiet about it. There are plenty of reasons for this secrecy. Law enforcement often does not want to tip off a target, or someone’s life could be put at risk if certain information is revealed. Microsoft argues, however, that law enforcement is overdoing it with its gag orders and unfairly depriving the company of its right to be transparent with its customers. The case could wind its way through the courts for years. So maybe a decade from now we’ll find out who was on the right side of the law.

Micromax welcomes Marshmallow with Canvas Spark 2 Plus | tech$gadgets | Hindustan Times

 Micromax just introduced the world to their next phone -- Canvas Spark 2 Plus -- from the lineup of 15 smartphones scheduled for 2016.  The new budget phone available on Snapdeal costs Rs 3,999. It has a decent 5-inch screen, 8 GB internal storage, 1 GB of RAM, 5 MP rear camera and run Android Marshmallow 6.0  out of the box. The phone might suffer from poor battery life because of a puny 2,000 mAh battery but considering that the company is using this phone as a gateway drug for feature phone users with a low-end pricing, it doesn’t seem like too bad an idea.  “A large number of consumers are still using feature phones or a second hand phones, which provide immense scope and potential for them to upgrade to affordable smartphones. With the launch of the Canvas Spark 2 Plus, we are offering first time users, with a smooth transition at a wallet-friendly price. Our objective is to convert feature phone users into smartphone users, and synthesize technology and affordability in for this device,” said Shubhajit Sen, Chief Marketing Officer, Micromax Informatics. Micromax’s Canvas Spark 2 Plus is loaded with their Indus feature. Users can type, chat or change the menu of their phone in their preferred language out of the 10 that they support. Also, a swipe to the right can translate and to the left can transliterate messages in the preferred language.  The phone will be available for purchase on Snapdeal from April 22 in an attractive three colours- Metallic Grey, Copper Gold and Champagne Gold.

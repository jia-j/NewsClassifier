Xperia Z3 gets Android N preview before Nexus 5 | tech$news | Hindustan Times

 The Sony Xperia loyalists finally have something to cheer for as Google’s latest Android N preview is made available on the Z3. While older Google devices like the Nexus 5 are still waiting for a build of Android N, Sony has pulled a fast one by making it possible for a non-Nexus device owner to try out the latest version of Android with the help of their PC companion.  Android N developer preview looks and feels a lot like Android Marshmallow and Lollipop because of the material design language, but brings a host of enhancements like clear all button in the task switcher. For power users, it offers split screen mode in portrait and landscape orientations for great multi-tasking. While similar feature is already available on iOS, it only works on the larger iPads.  The introduction of Android N to Xperia Z3 could hint towards the revival of Google Play edition of devices, where alternative versions of a smartphone is launched with stock Android and first-hand access to the latest updates.  This was a strategy used by Google till January 2015, but didn’t work because stock Android wasn’t ready to take on the enhanced versions from the likes of Samsung or Xperia.

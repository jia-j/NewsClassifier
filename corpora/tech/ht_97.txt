For those annoyed by junk mail and spam, the Throttle plugin wants to make life easier. Starting on Tuesday, the service -- which launched in January -- will be free for all users, reports Tech Crunch. The company is also offering a Pro version for $3.99 per month, which supports multiple accounts. Throttle operates by generating a single email address for every newsletter you sign up for online or purchase you make. Then, all the emails are combined and sent in one daily email. The emails are also available on the Throttle website. Throttle is currently available for Chrome, Safari and Opera, and coming soon to Firefox.

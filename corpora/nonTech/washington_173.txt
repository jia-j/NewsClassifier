 Tom Wilson not injured after hard hit; Brooks Orpik’s status unclear - The Washington Post
With two minutes left in Game 4, Washington Capitals forward Tom Wilson went back to the locker room after a hit by Philadelphia’s Brandon Manning. On Thursday, Wilson said he feels good and leaving the game early was a precautionary move. “It was a hard hit,” Wilson said. “I feel good today, the usual. Nowadays, you’ve got to be extra careful, so [head athletic trainer Greg Smith] just said, ‘Go back, and get checked out.’ But I feel good and should be good to go.” Manning hit Wilson in the head.

While Capitals Coach Barry Trotz took issue with some things the Flyers did in Game 4, which the Capitals lost, 2-1, Manning’s hit on Wilson wasn’t one of them. “I watched it,” Trotz said. “I think that was sort of a hockey play gone bad because the puck went over to Willy, sort of in his feet. He got hit sort of one way and guy slid underneath him. … I didn’t think anything of it.” Orpik’s status unclear Defenseman Brooks Orpik didn’t play in Game 4 because of an upper-body injury he suffered in Game 3, and Trotz wasn’t definitive on his status for Friday’s Game 5 at Verizon Center. “We’re going to skate tomorrow, and I don’t know if he’ll skate or not,” Trotz said. On Wednesday, Trotz said Orpik was “doing better” after a hit by Flyers center Ryan White crunched him against the glass. With Orpik out of the lineup, Taylor Chorney skated on the third pair with Dmitry Orlov, and Trotz praised his performance. Washington didn’t practice on Thursday, but Orpik didn’t skate with the team on Tuesday or Wednesday.

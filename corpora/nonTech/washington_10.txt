 Jason Hatcher retires after 10 NFL seasons - The Washington Post
Defensive end Jason Hatcher will retire from the NFL after 10 seasons, according to his agent Jordan Woy on Friday. Hatcher spent the final two seasons of his career with the Washington Redskins following eight years with the Dallas Cowboys. Jason Hatcher (Cowboys/redskins) is retiring from the NFL. A great player and better friend. His leadership will be missed by teammates. — Jordan Woy (@JordanWoy) April 15, 2016  Hatcher had been contemplating retirement near the end of last season, but the 33-year-old still had a desire to play once the Redskins released him prior to free agency. The Alexandria, La. native finished with 34.5 career sacks in 147 games. Hatcher recorded 7.5 sacks in 28 games with Washington once he joined the team in 2014. Appearing in 15 games last season, Hatcher played through a number of injuries at the end of the season and often received Wednesdays off to rest his body. He had two sacks, 20 combined tackles and served as one of the leaders on the NFC East division championship team. Hatcher was a third-round selection in the 2006 NFL Draft by the Cowboys out of Grambling State. His best season was 2013, his final one in Dallas, when he recorded a career-high 11 sacks and earned his only Pro Bowl nod.

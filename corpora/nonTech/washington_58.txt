 Lohman’s bicycle kick lifts Washington Spirit in NWSL opener, 1-0 - The Washington Post
Joanna Lohman scored on a bicycle kick in the third minute Saturday, lifting the Washington Spirit to a 1-0 victory over the Boston Breakers in the National Women’s Soccer League opener before 3,578 at Maryland SoccerPlex in Boyds. Lohman, a 33-year-old midfielder from Silver Spring, received Crystal Dunn’s end-line cross and struck her spectacular shot from six yards against her former team. Lohman had joined the Spirit last season after two years with Boston. Stephanie Labbe, a Canadian national team goalkeeper, made one save in posting a shutout in her first appearance for the Spirit. “It was a good test for us in concentration to make sure that we defended and kept the ball in their half for the last 15 to 20 minutes,” Coach Jim Gabarra said. Washington will visit New Jersey-based Sky Blue FC next Sunday and the Western New York Flash on April 29 before returning to the SoccerPlex on May 7 to face the Portland Thorns. In the other NWSL matches Saturday, 8,022 watched defending champion FC Kansas City lose at home to the Western New York Flash, 1-0, and 7,440 turned out for the Houston Dash’s 3-1 victory over the Chicago Red Stars. Earlier, the league announced that Houston’s BBVA Compass Stadium will stage the Oct. 9 championship game. 🇺🇸 @JoannaLohman bicycle kick in front of goal. 👀😮 #NWSL pic.twitter.com/9rVjXOKcD7 — Womens Football Comp (@Jigsawwill) April 16, 2016  Spirit lineup: Stephanie Labbe; Ali Krieger, Megan Oyster, Shelina Zadorsky, Caprice Dydasco; Joanna Lohman, Tori Huster, Christine Nairn; Crystal Dunn, Katie Stengel (Cali Farquharson 64th), Estefania Banini (Diana Matheson 75th).

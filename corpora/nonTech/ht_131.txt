Australia thrash India 4-0 to win record 9th Sultan Azlan Shah Cup | other sports | Hindustan Times
A dominant Australia thrashed India 4-0 in the final of the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup hockey tournament in Ipoh, Malaysia, on Saturday. Thomas William Craig (25th, 35th minute) scored twice while Matt Ghodes (43rd, 57th minute) too found the net two times for Australia as the in-form Kookaburras won the tournament for a record ninth time. The result meant Australia lifted the trophy with an all-win record. For the reigning world champions and world number one, Craig opened the scoring in the 25th minute when he dribbled past a couple of Indian defenders and dragged goalkeeper Akash Chikte out before putting the ball into an empty net. Craig doubled the lead when he lunged into a cross in the 35th minute for his fourth goal of the tournament. It was the turn of Ghodes then to join the party as he scored two more goals to complete a convincing win against an opponent making its seventh appearance in the final of the event. Ghodes was playing in his 150th match. Ghodes scored his first goal through a volley, while the second one came barely three minute before the final hooter, as the script refused to change with Australia continuing their denomination over seventh ranked India, who won the tournament five times in the past. India finished third in the last edition. India started well as the first quarter ended goalless, but conceded once in the second quarter. The Aussies though were way ahead of their opponents when play resumed after the first half.

 Jason Chimera scores fluke goal on Steve Mason with deflection from red line - The Washington Post
Seconds after Steve Mason went to a full split to make a pad save on John Carlson’s one-time attempt early in the second period of Game 2 on Saturday at Verizon Center, the Flyers’ goalie gave up one of the softest — and flukiest — goals you’ll ever see. Jason Chimera deflected Karl Alzner’s clearing attempt from deep in the Capitals zone at the red line and the puck trickled toward Mason, who allowed it to go right through his legs. Alzner and Matt Niskanen were credited with the assists on Chimera’s ridiculous goal, which gave the Capitals a 2-0 lead.

Scoring Drought Ends, but Red Bulls Lose Again - The New York Times
Although the Red Bulls got a reprieve from the shutouts that have piled up this season, they fell to last place in the Eastern Conference with a 2-1 loss to the host Colorado Rapids on Saturday. Defender Ronald Zubar’s header in the 60th minute ended the Red Bulls’ scoring drought but was not enough in a game played amid snow flurries. After a first-half goal by Colorado’s Jermaine Jones, Zubar headed home the tying goal from just outside the 6-yard box. Sacha Kljestan lofted the ball to Zubar after a corner kick by Kljestan bounced right back to himself. The Colorado substitute Dominique Badji scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute. The Red Bulls (1-6) were shut out in five of their first six games. VILLA SCORES TWICE IN LOSS New York City F.C. forward David Villa scored his third and fourth goals of the season, but he could not prevent N.Y.C.F.C. from losing, 3-2, to the host Columbus Crew. The loss to a previously winless team stings, and N.Y.C.F.C. (1-3-2) has not won since the season opener. After Columbus opened the scoring, Villa evened the game when he headed a high cross from Andoni Iraola in the 15th minute. Kei Kamara and Justin Meram each scored in the second half to give Columbus a 3-1 lead. When Villa connected on a penalty kick in the 87th minute, he gave N.Y.C.F.C. hope for a late equalizer that never came. Villa has a team-high four goals in six games. He led N.Y.C.F.C. with 18 goals last year.

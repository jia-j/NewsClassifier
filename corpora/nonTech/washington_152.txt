 Yes, you’ll be able to watch Friday’s Caps-Flyers game at Nats Park - The Washington Post
The Capitals host the Flyers at Verizon Center on Friday night with a chance to close out their first-round Stanley Cup playoff series. Bryce Harper and the Nationals will open a three-game set against the Twins two miles away at the same time. What’s a D.C. sports fan to do? If you have tickets to the Capitals game, you should probably use them. If you have tickets to the Nationals game and are wondering if you’ll be able keep an eye on the Caps at Nationals Park, the answer is yes, which should make Harper happy. A Nationals spokesperson said the Capitals game will be shown on televisions “at various locations throughout the park” and score updates from Verizon Center will be provided on the scoreboard during the game. The spokesperson could not confirm whether the Capitals-Flyers game would be shown at the Anheuser-Busch-sponsored bar in center field formerly known as the Red Porch, as has been the case in previous years, but did say that the Caps game would not be limited to the club level. Just look for the people huddled around a TV at a baseball game.  C A P S! Fans refusing to leave Nats Park until Caps game is over. #DCforever A photo posted by Deborah (@zicklerarts) on May 4, 2015 at 7:04pm PDT  By my count, Friday will mark the 28th time that a Capitals playoff game has overlapped with a Nationals home game. (That’s not counting games on the same day when, say, the Nats started at 1 p.m. and the Caps didn’t play until 7 p.m.)

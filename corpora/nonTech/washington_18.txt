 Alex Ovechkin sends Brayden Schenn into the Flyers bench with crushing hit - The Washington Post
Alex Ovechkin missed a wide-open net early in the first period of Game 2 of the Eastern Conference quarterfinal series on Saturday, but the Capitals captain didn’t whiff on his check of Flyers center Brayden Schenn in front of the Philadelphia bench. Ovechkin lined up Schenn, who leveled Karl Alzner as the final horn sounded in Washington’s 2-0 win on Thursday, and helped him over the boards with a crushing hit that had the Verizon Center crowd cheering ‘O-vi! O-vi! O-vi!’ Ovi launches Schenn into the Flyers bench #CapsFlyers pic.twitter.com/NUOnlaYCQz — CAPITALS HILL (@CapitalsHill) April 16, 2016  Ovechkin checks Schenn into the bench.

U.N.L.V. Hires New Mexico State’s Marvin Menzies - The New York Times
Nevada-Las Vegas has moved swiftly to hire a new basketball coach after Chris Beard’s sudden exit, agreeing with New Mexico State’s Marvin Menzies on a five-year contract. Menzies is a former U.N.L.V. assistant who has been at New Mexico State for nine years. Beard agreed to coach U.N.L.V. less than two weeks ago, but he left on Friday for Texas Tech, where he was an assistant for 10 years.

 Cubsâ€™ Jake Arrieta throws first no-hitter of 2016, blanks the Reds - The Washington Post
Jake Arrieta and the Cubs proved entirely too much for the Reds Thursday night. ChicagoÂ poundedÂ out 16 runs on 18 hits, andÂ the teamâ€™sÂ starting pitcher threw the first no-hitter of the still-young MLB season. Holding theÂ RedsÂ to just four walks while striking out six in nine dominant innings, Arrieta hurled the second no-hitter of his career in a 16-0 win at Great American Ball Park in Cincinnati. The first one came in August 2015 against the Dodgers, the highlightÂ of a breakout campaign that resulted in an NL Cy Young award for the former Oriole. Jake Arrieta became the 3rd pitcher in Cubs history to throw multiple no-hitters, joining Larry Corcoran (3) and Ken Holtzman (2) â€” ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) April 22, 2016  The Cubs scored 16 runs in Jake Arrieta's no-no, second most runs in a no-hitter in MLB history behind the 1884 Buffalo Bisons (18) â€” ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) April 22, 2016  Arrieta became the fifth active pitcher with multiple no-hitters, joining Max Scherzer, Tim Lincecum, Homer Bailey and Justin Verlander.Â Arrieta got Cincinnatiâ€™sÂ Eugenio Suarez to pop up for the final out Thursday, then he was mobbed by his teammates, starting with catcher David Ross.

Jake Arrieta threw the first no-hitter of the year and a random fan joined the celebration ðŸ˜‚ https://t.co/lpVhZi4VMK â€” UPROXX Sports (@UPROXXSports) April 22, 2016  The Reds had owned the longest regular season streak in MLB of not getting no-hit, having last suffered that fate in June 1971, by the Philliesâ€™ Rick Wise. However, Cincinnati was no-hit in the playoffs much more recently, by the Philliesâ€™ Roy Halladay in aÂ 2010 divisional series. Reds did have longest streak w/out being no-hit in the reg. season. That honor now belongs to Athletics, who have not been no-hit since 1991 â€” ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) April 22, 2016  The no-hitter Thursday continues a remarkable turnaround for Arrieta, who was 20-25 with a 5.46 ERA when the Orioles gave up on him in July 2013, trading him andÂ reliever Pedro Strop to the Cubs for starter Scott Feldman and backup catcher Steve Clevenger. Since arriving in Chicago, Arrietaâ€™s ERA has droppedÂ from 3.66 in 2013 to 2.53 in 2014, 1.77 last season and now to 0.87 through four starts this season.

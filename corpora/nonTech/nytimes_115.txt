N.B.A. Denies Anti-Lin Bias on Fouls  - The New York Times
The N.B.A. issued a response on Friday to an article in The New York Times about a fan-made video that highlighted multiple forceful fouls on the Charlotte Hornets guard Jeremy Lin. The article first appeared online Thursday and centered on Hsiu-Chen Kuei, 48, of San Jose, Calif., whose video, “Jeremy Lin: Too Flagrant Not to Call,” has been viewed on YouTube more than one million times. In the video, Kuei depicts several instances, in which Lin was the recipient of hard contact around his head and wonders why no flagrant fouls were called. “After reviewing our extensive officiating database, we have found no data that suggests Jeremy Lin is disadvantaged by our officiating staff,” the N.B.A. wrote in a statement posted to its website. The N.B.A.’s response to the video and article was based on leaguewide foul statistics. The league said that over the past three seasons, Lin ranked 21st among all players in total drives to the basket, with 1,537, and that he had drawn the seventh-highest number of fouls among the 23 players who attempted more than 1,500 drives during those seasons. “Furthermore,” the N.B.A. wrote, “given the infrequency of flagrant fouls (roughly 1 per every 500 foul calls), it is not statistically significant that none of Mr. Lin’s 814 fouls drawn were deemed flagrant. But Kuei was not as concerned about aggregate data or how Lin compared with leaguewide totals as she was about specific instances, in which opposing players were not penalized for delivering blows to his head. The N.B.A. reiterated that it did not believe any of the plays shown in the video — which included hard hits on Lin from Kobe Bryant, Carmelo Anthony and James Harden, among others — were flagrant fouls.

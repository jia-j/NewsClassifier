Champion Felix Sturm Tests Positive for Steroid - The New York Times
Felix Sturm, the world super middleweight champion, announced that he had tested positive for an anabolic steroid after his win over Fedor Chudinov on Feb. 20. Sturm, 37, was found to have the steroid Hydro-XY Stanozolol in his A sample after his majority decision rematch win for the World Boxing Association belt. Sturm faces a two-year ban, provided that the B sample indicates a positive result, which could bring an end to his career. “I’ll definitely have the B sample opened,” Sturm said. “I have had my blood and urine tested hundreds of times. Nothing has ever been found. I have an absolutely clear conscience.”

 MLS suspends Galaxy’s Nigel de Jong for 3 matches for tackle on Darlington Nagbe - The Washington Post
As the Insider first reported Wednesday, the MLS Disciplinary Committee has suspended Los Angeles Galaxy midfielder Nigel de Jong for three matches for his tackle on Portland’s Darlington Nagbe last Sunday. MLS issued a statement Friday, saying, “While de Jong received a yellow card during the match, the Disciplinary Committee was unanimous that the action was a clear and unequivocal red card and the play was of an egregious and reckless nature such that the Committee must act to protect player safety.” The notorious Dutchman will miss matches against the Dynamo in Houston on Friday, vs. Real Salt Lake next weekend and at Sporting Kansas City on May 1. He was also fined an undisclosed amount. Nagbe suffered an ankle sprain and is likely to miss at least a few matches. Video:

 Thursday kickaround: DCU stadium, CONCACAF, Americans abroad, MLS refs - The Washington Post
In announcing a ceremonial demolition event with the mayor Monday at Buzzard Point, D.C. United said its new venue will tentatively be called “D.C. United Stadium” and seating capacity will be 20,000. Of course, the title will change when the club sells the naming rights to a corporate sponsor, presumably before the facility opens in 2018. And the specific number of seats probably will not be set until design and construction plans are finalized. But the 20,000 figure is important because, given the narrow physical footprint of the project in Southwest D.C., the club had been floating the possibility of as few as 18,000 seats. As for the demolition event, the public is welcome to attend. Festivities will begin at 11 a.m. at Second and S streets SW. This is not a formal groundbreaking, only a symbolic ceremony as the city prepares to hand over the land to the club as early as this summer. United is aiming to break ground in late 2016. The construction timetable is 14-18 months. ******************** Club America took a giant step toward retaining the CONCACAF Champions League title by winning at Tigres, 2-0, in the first leg of the finals. A place in the FIFA Club World Cup next winter is at stake. U.S. defender Ventura Alvarado played all 90 minutes for America. Tigres midfielder Jose Torres, the former U.S. international, started and went 70 minutes. The second leg is next Wednesday at Azteca Stadium.

Soares played 90 in Viking’s 1-0 home defeat to Brann ******************** Officiating decisions have caused a storm of controversy this MLS season and, in the latest review by PRO, the organization overseeing the referees, training and development manager Paul Rejer takes on a case of mistaken identity in the Columbus-New York City FC match when Michael Parkhurst was sent off instead of teammate Tyson Wahl. Rejer does not mince words, writing that referee Ted Unkel “has ‘lost’ the perpetrator and is told by a crew member that it was Parkhurst.” Rejer also wrote: “Referees should know their players, particularly MLS players who are well known, and should be aware of the difference between Michael Parkhurst and Tyson Wahl. As a crew member you should always be careful before imparting any information to the referee unless you are 100 percent certain into its validity.” The full review is available here. MLS overturned the decision, clearing Parkhurst of wrongdoing and suspending Wahl for one match instead. Wahl’s suspension was then overturned by a review panel.

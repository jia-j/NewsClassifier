 Sarah Palin blasts ESPN for firing Curt Schilling - The Washington Post
Sarah Palin isn’t a fan of how ESPN fired Curt Schilling, posting this on her Facebook page Thursday morning.  ESPN fired Schilling, one of its lead baseball commentators, on Wednesday night after the former Boston Red Sox pitcher shared a political cartoon about the so-called bathroom laws enacted in several states and then, after the uproar it caused, slammed his critics on his personal blog. Schilling has long made controversial political statements, in apparent violation of ESPN’s policy banning such outside commentary from its on-air employees.   [ESPN fires Curt Schilling for ‘unacceptable’ conduct]   “ESPN is an inclusive company,” the network said in a statement. “Curt Schilling has been advised that his conduct was unacceptable and his employment with ESPN has been terminated.” Palin has had Schilling’s back for a while now. In August, she wrote a post headlined “ESPN IS A JOURNALISTIC EMBARRASSMENT” after ESPN suspended Schilling over this now-deleted tweet:  “ESPN – what happened to you? Your intolerant PC police are running amok and making a joke out of you!” Palin wrote. “By picking and choosing who they’ll tolerate and who they’ll try to destroy, ESPN has zero credibility as a sound and reasonable media outlet.”

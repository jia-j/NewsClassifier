Runner Wins Three Titles in Four Hours - The New York Times
Caster Semenya won national titles in the 400, 800 and 1,500 meters and ran Olympic qualifying times in the first two events at the South African championships in Stellenbosch. Semenya, a former 800-meter world champion, set world-leading times in the 400 and 800. Finishing with the 1,500, Semenya became the first athlete to win all three titles at the championships, and she did it within about four hours. Semenyaâ€™s career has been tumultuous since she won the world 800 title in 2009 at 18. She was then suspended for nearly a year by the International Association of Athletics Federations after gender verification tests.

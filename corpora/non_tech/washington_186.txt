 Jayson Werth leaves Marlins game ‘as precaution’ with hamstring tightness - The Washington Post
MIAMI — A few innings after Joe Ross left Wednesday’s game early, left fielder Jayson Werth did the same because of tightness in his left hamstring. Werth did not go out to left field for the bottom of the fifth inning, replaced unexpectedly by Chris Heisey. Werth was 1 for 2 with a bloop single and had made two tough plays — a sliding catch coming in, and a lunging catch toward center. After his single in the fourth, Werth slid hard into second base to try to break up a double play. Neither Werth nor his manager specified when trouble began. “He’s off tomorrow anyway, before today started,” Baker said. “So I just thought as precaution he needs to take it out, take him out, take care of him.” Werth was walking out of the clubhouse as media entered after the game, but said he didn’t have anything to tell reporters. “I’m fine. I’ll be fine,” he said. Baker did not seem particularly concerned, and said he didn’t think this would be a long-term problem. “I’m trying to get them all to the hot weather. I’ve been saying that, that’s been my goal all along,” Baker said. “Especially the older players like Jayson and [Ryan Zimmerman] in particular. I’m trying to get those guys past the point where you’re not worried about them anymore. I’m not really concerned about this. A younger player might have tried to push it and something happened. But Jayson, being a veteran, he knows his body pretty well. I just said ‘Okay, man, I’m not even going to debate it.'” Werth, who hit his 200th career home run Wednesday night, is hitting .186 with two home runs and three doubles.

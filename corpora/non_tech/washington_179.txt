 Golf Digest cover features social media siren, much to LPGA players’ chagrin - The Washington Post
Lydia Ko is the top-ranked female player in the world, an 18-year-old prodigy who has won five of her past 14 LPGA tournaments, 12 overall with two major victories and has already amassed nearly $6 million in career earnings. Paige Spiranac is a former college player at San Diego State who missed the cut by eight strokes in her pro debut at December’s Dubai Ladies Masters, in which she received a sponsor’s exemption, and has yet to compete in an LPGA event. So guess who was just featured on the cover of Golf Digest, the first time either player has been so honored?  I'm so honored to say that I've landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest!

Of course, Ko only has 61,700 followers on Instagram, whereas Spiranac has more than 673,000 followers, who are regularly treated to fare such as this:  😌 #heylookmyfaceagain #stilllooksthesame A photo posted by Paige Spiranac (@_paige.renee) on Apr 12, 2016 at 8:23am PDT  Not surprisingly, some LPGA stars aren’t exactly delighted with Golf Digest’s decision. “You look at what Lydia Ko’s doing, and why isn’t she on the cover?” Hall of Famer Juli Inkster said to Golf Channel’s Randall Mell. “I know that stuff sells, and they are in the business of selling magazines, but I think people could learn more in an article about Lydia,” Inkster added. “It’s kind of where our society is right now. I don’t agree with it, but it’s their magazine and they can do what they want.” “You look across other platforms, I feel like people are starting to take notice of us as players and us as athletes, but Golf Digest seems to be the anomaly,” Stacy Lewis, the fourth-ranked player, said to Mell. Lexi Thompson is ranked No. 3 in the world. Last year, she was featured on Golf Digest’s cover — with nothing but a towel draped over her bare chest. I landed on the May cover of @GolfDigest !

Which is not to say that no women graced the magazine’s cover in the interim, because three did: then-Golf Channel host Holly Sonders, supermodel Kate Upton (appearing with Arnold Palmer) and Paulina Gretzky, daughter of Wayne and fiancee of PGA star Dustin Johnson.  So Excited To Be On The New Cover Of @golfdigestmag!!

You’ll note that she’s holding a trophy, reflective of the fact that golf tournaments, if not all golf magazines, reward excellent play. (H/T Awful Announcing)

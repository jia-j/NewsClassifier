 Capitals vs. Flyers: Game 2 discussion thread - The Washington Post
The playoffs continue for the Washington Capitals, who host the Philadelphia Flyers in Game 2 of this Eastern Conference quarterfinal series. Washington won Game 1, 2-0, and hope to protect home ice before the series moves to Philadelphia. The Capitals are 20-19 all-time in playoff Game 2s, 13-9 at home. Braden Holtby stopped all 19 shots he faced on Thursday in Game 1 to earn his third career playoff shutout, passing Don Beaupre and Semyon Varlamov for second place in franchise history. Holtby has allowed no more than one goal in 14 of his 17 career playoff wins, including each of his last 11 dating back to Game 6 of the 2012 Eastern Conference semifinals against the Rangers. Holtby ranks first among active goaltenders (with a minimum of 20 games played) in career playoff goals-against average (1.86) and save percentage (.937). In addition, Holtby is also first in franchise playoff history in both goals-against average and save percentage, and third in wins and games played. The Capitals out-shot the Flyers, 31-19, on Thursday, allowing just eight shots on goal in the last 40 minutes of the game. Washington will look to again take advantage of a forward corps that’s missing center Sean Couturier, a quality defensive forward considered a Selke Trophy candidate by some. Washington isn’t expected to have any lineup changes. The lineup is below, and the discussion thread is now open. Forwards Alex Ovechkin-Nicklas Backstrom-T.J.

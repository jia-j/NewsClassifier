 U.S. men’s national team will play May 22 friendly at Puerto Rico - The Washington Post
The U.S. men’s national soccer team will play Puerto Rico in a May 22 friendly in Bayamon, P.R., the first meeting between sides with close geographical, political and cultural ties. Kickoff is at noon ET on FS1, UniMas and Univision Deportes. The game will serve as the first of three U.S. friendlies ahead of Copa America, which will begin June 3. Matches against Ecuador (May 25 in Frisco, Tex.) and Bolivia (May 28 in Kansas City, Kan.) were announced earlier this spring. The Puerto Rico game was a late addition to the calendar because Jurgen Klinsmann wanted to keep his European- and Mexican-based players in rhythm before Copa America training camp begins in earnest. The players from abroad will report to camp May 16 in Miami, but the MLS contingent is not available until after league matches May 21-22. To fill out the roster for the Puerto Rico visit, Klinsmann plans to summon under-23 and under-20 players. Those players will not join the full squad for Copa training camp. “This will be an important opportunity for our players to stay sharp and keep progressing towards our opener against Colombia,” Klinsmann said. “We appreciate all the efforts by the Puerto Rican Football Federation to help organize the match.” Puerto Rico is preparing for Caribbean Cup qualifiers against Grenada and Antigua & Barbuda in early June. Klinsmann must submit his 23-man Copa roster by May 20.

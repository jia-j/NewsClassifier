 MLB players honored Prince by using his songs as walk-up music - The Washington Post
People everywhere were shaken by the news Thursday of Prince’s death, and baseball players were no different. Some of them decided to honor the late pop icon by using his songs for their walk-up music.   [RIP Prince: The sports world reacts to entertainer’s death]   One of those players was Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez, who went with a different Prince tune for each of his four at-bats, including “Erotic City,” “Kiss,” “Pop Life” and “Alphabet Street.” After the game, Rodriguez said (via ESPN), “It was a tribute to one of the great legends.” Sounds like ARod used "Erotic City" by Prince as his walk-up music. Wouldn't have been my first choice but hey, he'll do what he'll do. — Andrew Harts (@AndrewHarts) April 21, 2016  Such sad news about @Prince passing.

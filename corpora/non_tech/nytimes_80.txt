UConn Coach Auriemma Hospitalized With Undisclosed Illness - The New York Times
STORRS, Conn. â€”  UConn women's basketball coach Geno Auriemma has been hospitalized with an undisclosed illness. The school released a statement saying the 62-year-old Auriemma had boarded a plane Saturday morning at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, but decided to deplane because he was not feeling well. The school says he was taken to a hospital for observation and is resting comfortably. The Hall of Fame coach guided the Huskies to an unprecedented 11th national title this month. But, he missed the victory parade in Hartford last weekend and did not accompany the team when it was honored by lawmakers at the state Capitol this week, because he was feeling ill. He attended the WNBA draft Thursday, but did not speak with reporters. Auriemma is 955-134 in 31 seasons at UConn.

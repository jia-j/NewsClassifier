 Machado comes up big to vault Orioles past Blue Jays - The Washington Post
 BALTIMORE — It was supposed to be a high-scoring series between two big-swinging teams, but the Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays played three low-scoring, one-run games and the series was still up in the air in the eighth inning Thursday night. Manny Machado — who else? — finally decided it with a bloop double into short right field, which scored Joey Rickard — again, who else? — with the go-ahead run in a 3-2 Orioles victory before 17,644 at Camden Yards. The victory gave the Orioles their third consecutive series victory over a division rival, and this one was particularly uplifting because the Orioles lost the first game before grinding out two tough late-inning victories against the defending American League East champions. Like Wednesday night’s game, this one did not look like it was going to be a tight pitching duel at the outset. The Blue Jays sent eight batters to the plate in the first inning and Chris Tillman was lucky to get out of the jam with only two runs across. He needed 38 pitches to do that, which certainly didn’t point to him completing six innings. The Orioles also came out swinging against Blue Jays starter Marco Estrada, who gave up three straight hits to start the bottom of the first and also had to pull something of an escape act to get off the mound holding a 2-1 lead. The two pitchers combined to throw 57 pitches before the Orioles made their first out of the game.   — Baltimore Sun

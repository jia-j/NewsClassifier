University Scrutinizing Sheryl Swoopes’s Coaching - The New York Times
Sheryl Swoopes, one of the most accomplished athletes in women’s basketball history, will be investigated over accusations that she mistreated players at Loyola University Chicago, where she recently completed her third season as the women’s basketball coach. Ten of the 12 players eligible to return have either transferred or asked for a release, on top of five who transferred last year, according to The Chicago Tribune. “Anytime there are allegations of student-athlete mistreatment, it is more than concerning,” Jermaine Truax, the university’s deputy athletic director, said in a statement Friday. The athletics department, he added, “has asked for an independent and comprehensive university investigation into the women’s basketball program.” Swoopes will fully cooperate with the inquiry, according to the statement. Last season, she led the Ramblers to a 14-16 finish, but they had a winning record in the Missouri Valley Conference, in which they finished fifth. There have been several recent high-profile reports of coaches mistreating college athletes, who typically lack the formal process for filing grievances that professional athletes have. Last year, the University of Illinois fired its football coach, Tim Beckman, one week before the season began after the preliminary examination in a larger investigation revealed that he had inappropriately influenced players’ medical decisions and encouraged injured athletes to compete. He settled a wrongful termination lawsuit against the university this month for $250,000. There has not yet been any suggestion of how Swoopes might have mistreated players. Her contract runs through the 2017-18 season. Swoopes, 45, starred at Texas Tech in the early 1990s. She is a three-time Olympic gold medalist and a three-time most valuable player in the W.N.B.A. who led the Houston Comets to the first four league titles, from 1997 through 2000.

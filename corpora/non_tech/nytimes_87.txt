Jaromir Jagr vs. Islanders: A Long, Point-Filled History - The New York Times
In his 22 N.H.L. seasons, Jaromir Jagr has played more than 1,600 regular-season games. He has played more of them against the Islanders (109) than any other team. He has more regular-season goals (61), assists (93) and points (154) against the Islanders than any other player. Jagr, now 44, was even on the ice in Pittsburgh the last time the Islanders won a playoff series, in 1993. The Penguins, who had won the Stanley Cup the previous two seasons, met the Islanders in the division finals. Jagr, then 21, had goals in Games 3, 4 and 5 as Pittsburgh took a 3-2 series lead. But the Islanders won a physical Game 6 at Nassau Coliseum, 7-5, to force a Game 7 in Pittsburgh. “In the playoffs, you can make it come down to the team that has more heart, and we’ve got that,” Steve Thomas, who scored two goals for the Isles, said. “In some cases, we probably have more heart than ability.” Two days later, the Islanders held Jagr and Mario Lemieux without a goal, and David Volek’s goal in overtime sent the team to the Eastern Conference finals. An article on the victory ran in The New York Times under the headline, “Improbable. Impossible. Incredible. Islanders.” Since then, Jagr has won 13 playoff series, and the Islanders none. The Islanders captain John Tavares was not yet 3 years old the last time the Islanders saw Jagr across the ice in a playoff game. Now, 23 years later, Jagr is again facing the Islanders in the postseason. He leads the Florida Panthers in scoring with 66 points (27 goals, 39 assists), while playing on a line with 20-year-old Aleksander Barkov and 22-year-old Jonathan Huberdeau. Jagr will take 202 games of playoff experience into Game 1 Thursday night in Florida, with 78 goals and 121 assists. Over all, he is third in career regular-season goals with 749, sixth in assists with 1,119 and third in points with 1,868. Here are a few highlights of his career against the Islanders: Oct. 13, 1990: Scores first goal vs. Isles In his fifth N.H.L. game, Jagr scores his first career goal against the Islanders, in the third period of a 6-4 victory for the Penguins. This is how The New York Times article about the game described Jagr: Dec. 30, 1999: Has 7-point game Jagr had three goals and four assists for a career-high 7-point game as the Penguins routed the Islanders, 9-3. The Isles’ goaltender in that game? A 20-year-old rookie named Roberto Luongo, who is now Jagr’s teammate with the Panthers. “There’s nothing you can do about it now,” Luongo said at the time. “It’s just one of those nights. It’s not always going to go your way and tonight proves it. They did what they wanted to do. They dominated us.” March 1, 2014: Scores 700th career goal As a member of the Devils, Jagr, then 42, became the seventh player to reach 700 goals, scoring in the second period at Nassau Coliseum in a 6-1 victory. Wayne Gretzky and Marcel Dionne also scored their 700th career goals at Nassau Coliseum. The goal was to be the last of his 61 goals against the Islanders, but at the time he laughed when asked about the applause he received from Islanders fans. “Well, they knew I scored 61 goals against them,” he said. Jagr added: “I love that team; they are my favorite.” He also played down the significance of his 700th goal. “Seven hundred goals is pretty special, but 800 would be even better,” Jagr said. “I’ll get there in two years. And I’ll be laughing then, too.” He did not quite make it to 800 in the two years, but he has no plans to retire anytime soon.

# NewsClassifier
Classify news articles

The goal is to classify news articles into different categories: Tech and Non-Tech
I will use my Scraper repository to scrape various news websites (CNN, HindustanTimes, WashingtonPost) for training data
Algorithms used: k-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes
Added an additional feature that generates the summary of a news article
Code in Python; used sklearn, nltk
